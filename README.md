## Introduction

This project was an assignment in Object programming 2 (OBJ2100) from the University of Sout-East Norway (USN),
Campus Ringerike.
The goal of the assignment was to get to know how API's work using Java, Spring Web,
Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL. Personally this is the first time I've worked with an API.
